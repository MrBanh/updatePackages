In terminal, assuming the path where the script is stored is set in the PATH environment variable, type:

    python updatePackages.py

If you have a .bat file set up, and the .bat file is in a directory that is set in the PATH environment variable, type:

    updatePackages

Alternatively, you can just open and run the script.
